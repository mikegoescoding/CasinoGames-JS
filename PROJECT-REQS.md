## We are building a casino!

You are to build one casino game, black jack, slots, roulette, etc, ( these are the ones I have seen built out before.)

# Requirements:

Build the game:
> In addition, the player will have a wallet, they can add money to the wallet, any winnings they get will be added to the wallet.
> If the wallet goes empty they must add more money or they have to stop playing.
> They need to be able to stop playing and cash out the wallet at anytime. (bonus if the cash out process tells them if they made a profit or not)
> let the player set the dollar/cents amount of the bet (in the game).
> let them continue playing as long as they have money or decide to cash out.


* // INITIAL STEPS
* // FIGURE OUT A GAME!?!?
* // build a wallet. add / subtract winnings and losses
* // allow user to end game with current wallet total
* // let the user set the bet amount
* // keep track of wallet amount, user can keep playing until wallet reaches zero
